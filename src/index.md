I'm a front-end developer who lives and works in The Netherlands. I strongly believe that the web should
                be
                for everyone, and therefore I'm trying to make it as accessible and user-friendly as possible.

Currently, I'm doing just that while working at [Van Spaendonck Development](https://www.vanspaendonck.nl/) in
                Tilburg, where I work on products like [Loket.nl](https://www.loket.nl)
                and [Clever](https://www.clever.nl/).

In the past, I worked at [Handpicked Agencies](https://www.handpickedagencies.com/en) and [Truelime](https://www.truelime.nl/).

If you want to connect with me, you can find me on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@oerlemans), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timoerlemans/), [Github](https://www.github.com/timoerlemans/) or you can send me an old-fashioned e-mail (tim[at]oerlemans[dot]dev).
