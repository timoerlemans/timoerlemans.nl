## Hi, my name is Tim Oerlemans.

I'm a front-end developer who lives and works in The Netherlands. I strongly believe that the web should
                be
                for everyone, and therefore I'm trying to make it as accessible and user-friendly as possible.

Currently, I'm doing just that while working at [Van Spaendonck Development](https://www.vanspaendonck.nl/) in
                Tilburg, where I work on products like [Loket.nl](https://www.loket.nl)
                and [Clever](https://www.clever.nl/).
